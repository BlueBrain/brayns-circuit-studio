# Turn table

A turn table is a movie like this one:

<video src="small.mp4" controls title="Turn table example"></video>

It's something so common that we added a button to generate the keyframes for you.

Before hitting the **Create a turn table (360Â°)** button, make sure you have entered a movie duration and that the camera is placed as you want it to start.
